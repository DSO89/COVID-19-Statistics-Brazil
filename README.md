# COVID-19 - Statistics in Brazil

Statistical data about COVID-19 cases in Brazil.

This repository aggregates data about COVID-19 in Brazil from the Brazilian Ministry of Health and Brazilan Health State Offices, retrieved from https://labs.wesleycota.com/sarscov2/br/.

The general scenario until 24/03/2020 is presented below. I also have included comparisons between some states and the detail in SP State, the epicenter of the pandemic in Brazil.

I intend to make daily updates in this dataset, whenever possible.
