# COVID-19 - Dados Estatísticos sobre o Brasil

Dados estatísticos sobre os casos de COVID-19 no Brasil.

Este repositório é uma compilação dos dados de COVID-19 do Ministério da Saúde e das Secretarias de Saúde estaduais, retirados de https://labs.wesleycota.com/sarscov2/br/. O banco de dados pode ser encontrado na pasta ```Data``` em formato CSV. Comecei a compilação destes dados em 23/03/2020, mas a série temporal nacional inicia em 22/02/2020, quando houve a primeira confirmação de caso de COVID-19 na cidade de São Paulo, SP, o epicentro da pandemia no Brasil. 

Se você tem interesse em programação em Python e tem interesse em ajudar este projeto, por favor, dê uma olhada no arquivo ```COVID_19_Analysis.py```. Qualquer sugestão é muito bem vinda. Se preferir, pode me enviar um e-mail também: marco.couto@usp.br.

O cenário geral até 28/03/2020 é apresentado abaixo. Incluí o detalhe em alguns estados (SP, RJ, MG, DF, GO, BA, PE, CE, PR, SC, RS, AM e PA), apresentando o total de casos, novos casos e número de óbitos devido ao COVID-19. Há também comparações entre as situações de todos estados com SP e todos os estados com o Brasil. Todas as séries temporais de cada estado se iniciam no dia da confirmação do primeiro caso de COVID-19 neste estado (dia "0").

Pretendo atualizar esse repositório diaramente, sempre que for possível.


## Última atualização: 28/03/2020

No entanto, é possível encontrar os plots dos dias anteriores na pasta ```Figures```. Lá, você encontra também encontrará os plots de detalhe para cada estado desde que comecei este repositório.
