# COVID-19 - Statistics in Brazil

Statistical data about COVID-19 cases in Brazil.

This repository aggregates data about COVID-19 in Brazil from the Brazilian Ministry of Health and Brazilan Health State Offices, retrieved from https://labs.wesleycota.com/sarscov2/br/. The compiled dataset is in the folder ```Data``` in CSV format. I started to get the data on 23/03/2020, but the time series starts on 22/02/2020, when the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in SP state. 

If you have any interest in Python coding and help in this project, please, take a look in the file ```COVID_19_Analysis.ipynb```. Any suggestions are very welcome! You can e-mail me as well: marco.couto@usp.br.

The general scenario until 26/03/2020 is presented below. I also have included comparisons between SP, RJ, MG and DF with Brazil, the Brazilian states with SP and the detail in SP State, the epicenter of the pandemic in Brazil. The series for each state starts on the day of the first COVID-19 case confirmation in that state.

I intend to make daily updates in this dataset, whenever possible.

## Last update: 26/03/2020
However, you can find all figures from the previous days in the folder ```Figures```. There, you will find all the plots for each state and all states comparisons with SP and Brazil.
